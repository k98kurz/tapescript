# Tapescript

## Overview

This scripting language was inspired by Bitcoin script. The main use envisioned
is as a method for embedding ACL into decentralized data structures, e.g. hash
DAGs. The core mechanisms under the hood are the following:

1. Tape: the `Tape` takes the script bytes and advances a pointer as the bytes
are read. It also keeps a dict of flags which control how certain ops execute
and a dict of contracts mapping contract_id to dict contracts used for checking
transfers between compatible protocols.
2. Queue: the `LifoQueue` provides a memory structure similar to the stack used
in Forth and Bitcoin script. Most ops interact with the queue, and most values
are stored in the queue.
3. Cache: the `dict` cache is where special values are held, e.g. a timestamp or
the parts of a message to be used for checking signatures. Additionally, it is
possible to move items from queue to cache or vice versa with the limitation
that only `bytes` cache keys can be used for these operations while interpreter
values are stored with `str` cache keys and thus inaccessible to scripts.

## Syntax

The syntax of tapescript is simple and unforgiving, and it takes two forms: the
bytes fed into the interpreter and the human-readable source code fed into the
compiler which produces bytecode for the VM. The syntax for bytecode is just the
op code followed by its arguments. The syntax for human-readable code is
outlined below.

All symbols must be separated by whitespace, but which whitespace is used does
not matter. (Making source code easy on the eyes is still recommended, as it is
in any language; see [Style](## Style) section for detailed recommendations.)
Any op name, value, or bracket/parenthesis is a symbol.

### Values

All values in human-readable tapescript are prefixed by an encoding char:
- `d`: any value starting with `d` is an int or decimal float (e.g. `d123`)
- `s`: any value starting with `s` is is a string (e.g. `s"hello world"`)
- `x`: any value starting with `x` is hexadecimal bytes (e.g. `x00ff`)

Note that string escapes are not currently supported. It is especially important
to note that an escaped quotation mark will not be interpreted by the compiler
as escaped and will instead terminate the string and cause a syntax error.

### Comments

Everything between two hashtags or double quotes is disregarded as a comment.

### Calling ops

To call an op, write the op name followed by any argument(s). For example,
`OP_PUSH s"hello world"` will convert the utf-8 string "hello world" into bytes
and push it onto the queue, utilizing `OP_PUSH1`. Note that each op has an alias
equal to the name of the op without the `OP_` prefix.

### Subtapes

Some features are implemented using subtapes by reading a 2 byte uint size
argument from the tape, then reading that many bytes from the tape as the
subtape definition, then executing the subtape. Subtape definitions have a
maximum size of 64KiB (2^16-1 bytes). The following features use subtapes:

- `OP_IF`
- `OP_IF_ELSE`
- `OP_DEF`
- `OP_TRY_EXCEPT`
- `OP_EVAL`

Note that `OP_EVAL` does not require any arguments because it reads the top item
from the queue as the subtape definition rather than parsing one out from the
tape.

### Conditional programming

Tapescript includes three conditional operators: `OP_IF`, `OP_IF_ELSE`, and
`OP_MERKLEVAL`. `OP_IF_ELSE` is used under the hood for the human-readable
syntax of `OP_IF ( if_body ) ELSE ( else_body )`.

#### `OP_IF`/`OP_IF_ELSE`

Unlike in c- type languages, the condition is pulled from the queue by `OP_IF`/
`OP_IF_ELSE`, so the condition is not provided as an argument to the operators.

```s
OP_IF (
    OP_PUSH s"true value found on the queue"
) ELSE (
    OP_PUSH s"false value found on the queue"
)
```

If `OP_TRUE` was called, or non-null bytes were put on the queue in some other
way, before this script ran, the first branch will execute. If `OP_FALSE` was
called, or if null bytes were put on the queue, before this script ran, the
second branch will execute.

The bodies for both clauses must be between parentheses, or the final clause
must be terminated by `END_IF`, e.g. `OP_IF OP_DUP ELSE OP_POP0 END_IF`.

#### `OP_MERKLEVAL`

Tapescript includes a streamlined mechanism for branching scripts that hide the
unexecuted branches behind cryptographic commitments. The syntax for a locking
script using this mechanism is simply `OP_MERKLEVAL <root sha256 hash>`. This
op reads 32 bytes from the tape as the root digest; pulls a bool from the queue;
calls `OP_DUP` then `OP_SHA256`; calls `OP_SWAP d1 d2`; if not bool, calls
`OP_SWAP2`; calls `OP_CONCAT`; calls `OP_SHA256`; pushes root hash onto the
queue; calls `OP_EQUAL_VERIFY`; then calls `OP_EVAL`.

The unlocking script must provide the code of the branch to execute, the hash of
the unexecuted branch, and anything needed to execute the branch (in reverse
order). This generalizes to any number of levels of branches, but there can be
only two branches per level. These form a Merkle-tree like script structure.

See "Example 5: merklized script" in the [script_examples.md](https://github.com/k98kurz/tapescript/blob/master/script_examples.md#example-5-merklized-script)
file for a thorough example of how this works and how it compares to using
`OP_IF_ELSE` for conditional execution and cryptographic script commitments.

A tool is provided that generates the locking and unlocking scripts for use with
`OP_MERKLEVAL`. See the "#### Merklized Scripts" section of the readme for more
details.

### Exception handling

Some ops, such as `OP_VERIFY` and `OP_CHECK_EPOCH_VERIFY`, will raise exceptions
under certain conditions. If these ops are called within an `OP_TRY` block, the
exception will be caught, serialized, and put into the cache under the key x45,
then the `EXCEPT` block will be executed. Example:

```s
OP_TRY {
    OP_VERIFY
    OP_PUSH x20
} EXCEPT {
    OP_READ_CACHE x45
    OP_PUSH s"ScriptExecutionError|OP_VERIFY check failed"
    OP_EQUAL
}
```

The above results in a `20` hexadecimal value if it executed without error,
`true` if it raised a `ScriptExecutionError` with the given error message, and
`false` is some other error was raised.

This feature can be combined with soft forks for conditional logic.

```s
OP_TRY {
    OP_PUSH s"this is a new feature"
    OP_SOME_SOFT_FORK_RAISES_ERROR d1
    OP_PUSH s"old nodes will always execute this"
} EXCEPT {
    OP_PUSH s"old nodes will not execute this"
}
```

### Defining and calling functions

A function can be defined using `OP_DEF`. Up to 256 functions can be defined,
and all statements between the opening and closing curly braces (`{` and `}`)
or before a terminal `END_DEF` will be executed when the function is called
using `OP_CALL`. Each definition is referenced by an integer 0-255. Note that
the definition number passed as an argument for `OP_CALL` must be a value like
any other, while the integer used with `OP_DEF` can be a plain int or a value.

Also note that the compiler currently does not support defining functions within
other functions. The interpreter can probably handle it, but that would be
undocumented behavior. If I get feedback that indicates this would be a useful
feature to support, I will revisit the topic.

```s
OP_DEF 0 {
    OP_DUP
    OP_SHA256
}

OP_DEF 1
    OP_SHAKE256 d20
END_DEF

OP_PUSH x0123
OP_CALL d0
OP_CALL d1
```

This will define two functions, put the 2 bytes x0123 onto the queue, then call
the two functions in sequence. The result will be a queue with x0123 and
`shake_256(sha256(b'\x01\x23').digest()).digest(20)`.

### Macros and Variables

As of v0.3.0, the compiler supports macros and variables of a sort.

#### Macros

Macros are code templates that take in arguments and return the source code with
the template values replaced by the macro arguments.

To define a macro, use the following syntax:

```
!= name [ arg1 arg2 etc ] {
    OP_SOMETHING arg1
    OP_PUSH arg2
    OP_SOMETHING_ELSE
    # etc #
}
```

To invoke a macro, use the following:

```
!name [ arg1 arg2 etc ]
```

Only positional arguments are supported, and the values supplied to macro calls
must be valid. Each macro invocation will be followed by a separate compilation
of just the resulting code, and that bytecode will be inserted if successful.

#### Variables

Variables are simply syntactic sugar for using the cache as a set of registers.
The syntax is simple: `@= name [ values ]` to set and `@name` to copy the values
onto the stack. Variables cannot be used for arguments to ops.

## Style

While style of human-readable source scripts is not enforced, the following are
encouraged:

- Each statement invoking an op should be on its own line.
- The bodies of functions and conditional clauses should be indented. I
recommend 4 spaces per indentation level.
- The opening bracket of a function should be at the end of the line starting
`OP_DEF`, and the closing bracket of the function should be on its own line
following the final statement of the function body. If `END_DEF` is used instead
of brackets, then it should be on its own line.
- The opening parenthesis should be at the end of the line starting `OP_IF` or
`ELSE`, and the closing parenthesis should be on a new line following the final
statement of the conditional clause body.
- `ELSE` should be on the same line as the closing parenthesis of the previous
conditional clause, i.e. `) ELSE (` should be its own line.
- If `END_IF` is used instead of a closing parenthesis, it should be on its own
line following the final statement of the conditional clause.
- The type prefix of a value should be lowercase. If not, at least be consistent.
- The opening bracket of a try...except block should be at the end of the line
starting `OP_TRY`, and the closing bracket be on its own line following the
statements in the block. If an `EXCEPT` block is specified, it should be on the
same line as the closing bracket of the previous block. If `END_TRY` is used
instead of a closing bracket, then it should be on its own line.
- Brackets and parenthesis are recommended instead `END_DEF`/`END_IF`/`END_TRY`.
Choose a single convention and be consistent.

fork updates

### `OP_CHECK_TRANSFER count`

Reads the next byte from the tape, interpreting as an unsigned int `count`;
takes an item from the queue as a `contract_id`; takes an item from the queue as
an `amount`; takes an item from the queue as a serialized `constraint`; takes an
item from the queue as a `destination` (address, locking script hash, etc);
takes the `count` number of items from the queue as `sources`; takes the `count`
number of items from the queue as `txn_proofs`; verifies that the aggregate of
the transfers to the `destination` from the `sources` equals or exceeds the
`amount`; verifies that the transfers were valid using the proofs and the
contract code; verifies the `constraint` was followed for each txn proof; and
puts `True` onto the queue if successful and `False` otherwise. Sources and
proofs must be in corresponding order on the queue.

For this to work, the contract must be loaded into the tape's `contracts` dict
at the bytes `contract_id` dict key. This can be done by passing a contracts dict
into `run_script` or `run_auth_script`. If the contract should be loaded for all
script executions, instead it can be added with `add_contract(contract_id, contract)`.
The contract must be an instance of a class implementing the `CanCheckTransfer`
interface with following functions:
- `verify_txn_proof(txn_proof: bytes) -> bool`
- `verify_transfer(txn_proof: bytes, source: bytes, destination: bytes) -> bool`
- `verify_txn_constraint(txn_proof: bytes, constraint: bytes) -> bool`
- `calc_txn_aggregates(txn_proofs: list[bytes], scope: bytes = None) -> dict[bytes, int]`

The contract should be the source of the values put onto the queue and passed to
the contract functions by `OP_CHECK_TRANSFER count` or at least sharing an
interface with the source of those values.

The first three functions will be called on each transaction proof, and a `False`
returned for any of them will result in `False` placed onto the queue. Then,
`calc_txn_aggregates` will be called and supplied the list of txn proofs, and
the result for the destination will be taken out of the result of that function
call; if it is equal to or greater than the `amount` and all proofs were valid,
it puts `True` onto the queue, else it puts `False` onto the queue.
